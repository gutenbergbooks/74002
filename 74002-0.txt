CASTLE COURTYARD OF NOUGAT I.—_Suitors grouped about stage, looking up at

No. 1.

  | _Suitors._—The breezes of morning,
  |            Softly laden with perfumes,
  |            Betoken that breakfast is on the table,
  |            And the Royal family finishing
  |            The Charlotte Russe and lobster
  |            Salad, ’scolloped oysters, lemonade,
  |            And melted ice-cream,—left
  |            From last night’s party.
  |            ’Twas there we met her.
  |            Ah! ’twas there we lost our hearts.
  |            And early this morning we’ve come
  |            To make our party calls,
  |            To ask her hand,
  |            And serenade this lovely
  |            Princess Caramella.
  |
  | (_Then accompany upon guitars._)
  |
  | _Song._—   Maiden with golden hair,
  |            Maiden of beauty rare,
  |            List to our humble prayer,
  |                E’er we get thinner.
  |            Look out, we humbly pray,
  |            Turn not your eyes away,
  |            Ask us to call to-day,
  |                Also to dinner.
  |            Of this, would’st know the cause,
  |            Say we, without a pause,
  |            It is what we all love to do,
  |            All love to do.
  |            Hunger and love combined
  |            In us are closely twined.
  |            It is what we all love to do,
  |            All love to do.
  |
  | (_Interlude, with guitar accompaniment. All change to another
  | position and sing._)
  |
  | _2nd Verse._
  |
  |            Why doth the Chicadee
  |            Eat up the bumble bee?
  |            Why doth the sangaree
  |              Soak up the sugar?
  |            Why doth the little lamb
  |            Dance round the parent ram?
  |            Why doth the juicy clam
  |              Stay in salt water?
  |            Why doth the pretty fly
  |            Die in the apple pie?
  |            It is what they all love to do,
  |            All love to do.
  |            Why are we singing here
  |            To Caramella dear?
  |            It is what we all love to do,
  |            All love to do.

(_Suitors all crowd together at castle door, and consult._)

  _1st S._—Oh! where are servants? She’s at home, I trust.
               Let’s ring.

  _2d S._—                We dare not!

  _3d S._—                             Oh! we can’t!

  _1st S._—                                          We must!
      There’s no one here; we’ll have to ring this bell.
     _You_ do it. I’m too tired (_to 2d S._).

  _2d S._—                                    Very well.
      But stay! ’twill jar my nerves. (_To 3d S._) _You_ ring.

  _3d S._—                                                    What! _I?_
      With feelings so depressed? Oh, no! You try (_to 4th_).
      Here, ring!

  _4th S._—Ah! well, if so, I must. But, oh!
            Suppose there is a dog. _You_ ring (_to 5th S._).

  _5th S._—                                                  No! no!
      Perhaps they have a gun that shoots. Oh! dear.
      I am afraid. _You_ ring (_to 6th S._).

  _6th S._—                                 I’m dead with fear.
      I wonder if she’s in. What _shall_ we do?
          _You_ ring (_to 1st S._).

  _1st S._—      No. _You_ (_to 2d_).

  _2d S._—             No. _You_ (_to 3d_).

  _3d S._—                   No. _You_ (_to 4th_).

  _4th S._—                        No. _You_ (_to 5th_).

  _2d S._— How _can_ we do it?

  _1st S._—                  Do it in a crowd!
          By ringing all together—quick and loud.

(_Suitors all take hands down stage; go up hand in hand cautiously, and
prepare to ring._ 1ST S. _holding bell._)


No. 2.

_Music._—_Prelude._ (_All pull and sing._)

  | _All._—       Ring at the door-bell,
  |               Pull at the knocker;
  |               Ring at the door-bell. _Pull!_
  |
  | (_Pull door-bell out. All fall down stage. Music. Enter_ SASSY _and_
  | MAIDS C. _door._)
  |
  | _Sassy._—     Gentlemen, why do you ring so loudly
  |               That our door-bell gives away?
  |
  | _Suitors._—   We have come to see your Royal Mistress,
  |               Is she to be seen to-day?
  |
  | _Maids._—   { No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
  | _Suitors._— { Oh! in love, in love we are.
  |
  | _Maids._—   { You must see her Pa.
  | _Suitors._— {                Not with her Pa.
  |
  | _Maids._—   { For you strangers are.
  | _Suitors._— {         We’re from afar, we are.
  |
  | _Maids._—   { No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
  | _Suitors._— {                To see our love.
  |
  | _Maids._—   { You must talk with her Papa-a-a-a-a-a.
  | _Suitors._— {                Not her Papa a-a-a-a-a.
  |
  | (_Suitors step forward and show cards._)
  |
  | _2d Verse._
  |
  | _Suitors._—   Here you have our cards all neatly made by
  |               Tiffany, of New York city.
  |
  | _Sassy._—     That establishes your reputation.
  |               We will take them unto her.
  |
  | _Suitors._— { Please be sure they go to her.
  | _Maids._—   { We’ll be sure they go to her.
  |
  | _Suitors._— { Please be sure they go to her.
  | _Maids._—   { We’ll be sure they go to her.

(SUITORS _give cards to_ MAIDS. _Exeunt_ SASSY _and_ MAIDS _into house_
C.)

_Interlude._

(SUITORS _come down_ R. _front and sing._)


No. 3.

  | _Suitors._—When you love a Royal Princess,
  |              If it’s hard—send your card;
  |            She will have to marry, since es-
  |              Cape is hard, very hard;
  |            For she never likes to forfeit,
  |              Or retard, your regard;
  |            So you always can with profit,
  |              Send your card.
  |
  | (_King looks out of window_ C.—_takes up retarded note, and sings._)
  |
  | _King._—   Good morning, sirs, just wait until
  |            I can arrange my dish-y-bill.
  |            I have your cards, and will be down
  |            As soon as I can find my crown,
  |              My gilded sceptre, and my purple shirt.
  |                      (_Shuts window._)
  |
  | _Suitors._—Now we’re certain of the Princess
  |              For her dad has our card.
  |            She will have to marry, since es-
  |              Cape is hard, very hard;
  |            For the King won’t let her forfeit,
  |              Or retard, our regard;
  |            Thus we have, this time, with profit,
  |              Sent our card.

(_All talk together back_ R. _Music. Enter King with cards, to slow
dance._—KING _comes down_ C., _and sings._)


No. 4.

  | _King._— Of all the jolly fellows,
  |            The jolliest are Kings;
  |          They are utterly oblivious
  |            Of disagreeable things.
  |          Now I have been a pauper
  |            For the devil of a while,
  |          But as a King, I hide it
  |            With a long-drawn smile.
  |                              (_Smiles broadly._)
  |            With a side-long smile,
  |            With a long sighed smile,
  |          But as a King, I hide it
  |            With a long-drawn smile.
  |          Ha! Ha! (_Very joyful._)
  |                Ha! Ha! (_Melancholy._)
  |                      Ha! Ha! (_Very sadly._)
  |
  | _Music._
  |
  | (KING _takes slow dance up stage._)
  |
  | (_2nd Verse._)
  |
  |          Secure in his position,
  |            A monarch never cares
  |          If all his clothes are tattered,
  |            And filled with holes and tears.
  |          Just gaze upon this mantle,
  |            It’s nearly torn in half,
  |          But as a King I view it,
  |            With a long-drawn laugh.
  |                                  (_Smiles._)
  |          With a side-long laugh,
  |          Yes!—a long sighed laugh,
  |          But as a King, I view it,
  |          With a long-drawn laugh.
  |          Ha! Ha!
  |                Ha! Ha!
  |                      Ha! Ha!

(_Dances slowly around stage. Sees_ SUITORS _and speaks._)

  _King._—   Ah! gentlemen! Good morning—hope you’re well.

  _Suitors._—Yes!—thank your Highness!

  _King._—                           That is good—now tell
                Your business here.

  _Suitors._—                  Yes—thank your High—

  _King._—   (_Interrupting._)—                    Proceed!
             You come as suitors,

  _Suitors._—                  Yes, my liege!

  _King._—                                        Indeed!
  (_Aside._) Our daughter seems to be in great demand;
             I wonder if they only want her hand.
             That’s all that they can get—for I’m so poor
             I don’t know where to find my lunch. I’m sure
             The man that marries her must furnish gold,
             And do it now—at once—they must be told.

  (_Turning to Suitors. Aloud._)

             Now, gentlemen, to business—you are here
             As suitors for our daughter, that is clear.
             You love our daughter—if aright we read.

  _Suitors._—Oh, yes, your Highness, very much indeed.

  _King._—   Yes!—that is clear—now, as to worldly things
             Pray—let us see the gifts that each one brings.

  _Suitors._—The gifts! Your Highness—            (_Astonished._)

  _King._—                       Certainly—of course
             Some compensation equal to the loss
             To us—both for the time we’re wasting here,
             And for the losing of our daughter dear.

  _Suitors._—Good Gracious!                 (_Low to each other._)

  _King._—   (_Impatiently._) Well!—be quick!—here is our crown.
             Out with your money, now, and put it down.

  (_King holds crown behind him. Suitors all advance, and put in money._)

             ’Tis our unfailing custom—ever since
             The time when we became a Sovereign Prince,
             And had a daughter with enough good looks
             To ope to me—her suitors’ pocket-books—

  (_Takes money from crown and puts it in pocket._)

             And now as this small point of etiquette
             Has been so easily and surely met,
             We’ll ask you to excuse us for a while,
             Until we go and put your cards on file.
             And with the Princess, we’ll return again
             Within this court about the hour of ten.

  (_King bows, and exit_ C. _door. Suitors stand in same positions
  looking at each other in silence, feeling in pockets._—_Pause._)

  _1st S._—  Ah well! we’ve done it now. He has the gold;
             It’s customary I suppose, and old—
             It’s very sad—but stay! ’tis nearly ten,
             Let’s brush ourselves a bit and try again.

  (_Music and jingling of bells outside._)

  _1st S._—  What sound is that—how palpitates my heart,
             They must be coming—do you know your part?
             Get in your places—don’t appear to see,
             But fold your hands and sigh—and copy me.

_dancing_, _hand and hand._)


No. 5.

  | _Cara._—   I have no village cart,
  |              No pony phaeton;
  |            But out with Pa I start,
  |              And him I lay it on.
  |
  | _King._—   We run our own coupés,
  |
  | _Cara._—   Gig, landeau, coach and chaise,
  |
  | _King._—   Hack, cab, and jaunting car,
  |
  | _Cara._—   Trap and Victori_a_.
  |
  | _Chorus._ (CARA. _and_ KING _dance around stage._)
  |
  | _Suitors._—Hi yar! Hi yar! Just see her run her Pa-ha-ha.
  |            Hi yar! Hi yar! She ought to drive a car-ha-ha.
  |            Hi yar! Hi yar! This beats a jaunting car-ha-ha.
  |            Hi yar! Hi yar! A swell Victoria. Ha-ha.—(_Repeat faster._)
  |
  | _2d Verse._
  |
  | _Cara._—   On every pleasant day
  |            Driving is our resource,
  |            We wander far away;
  |            Nor do we need a horse?
  |
  | _King._—   If rain begins to fall,
  |
  | _Cara._—   We take the carryall,
  |
  | _King._—   Or if the skies are free,
  |
  | _Cara._—   Jump in the light buggee.
  |
  | _Chorus._— Hi yar! Hi yar! etc. (_Repeated like 1st verse._)

(CARA. _suddenly sees_ SUITORS—_stops, changes manner_—_then to_ SUITORS.)

  _Cara._—   Hey-day! what’s this?

  _King._—                   These gentlemen, my dear,
             Are suitors for your hand.

  (SUITORS _all look down, meekly._)

  _Cara._—                             So they appear.
             I’m bored to death by suitors,—go away.

  _King._—   Just listen first to what they have to say,
             They surely are entitled to be heard,
  (_Aside._) Besides, they’ve paid out money for a word.

  _Cara._—   Indeed. Well, let them talk, I’m all suspense;
             Proceed, kind gentlemen, but utter sense.

(SUITORS _all come down meekly and sing._)


No. 6.

(_Music._)

  | _Suitors._—Oh! Princess, we can talk and warble
  |              In a most agreeable way,
  |            At tennis we are very prominent,
  |              And also great at croquet.
  |            We play at battledore and shuttlecock—
  |              In knickerbockers arrayed,
  |            But are particularly pleasant

(_All dance furiously_, CARA. _and_ KING _laughing. At end of music_
SUITORS _all get down on knees and wait._)

  _Cara._ (_sarcastically_).—
             And is this all? Quite finished? Surely done?
             Not overlooked a single charm—not one?
             You all excel in something—so you say;
                                   (_Changing tone quickly._)
             You don’t excel enough—please go away.

  (_Turns back on_ SUITORS _and goes down_ R.)

  _Suitors._—Alas!

  _King._—   We feel most sorry for your woe,
             But such is fate. We fear you’ll have to go.

  _1st S._—  Have pity, oh! your Highness. See us here
             Most miserable suitors. See that tear.
                                  (_Showing handkerchief._)
             Be kind to us poor suitors.

  _King_ (_sternly._)—                      Gentlemen!
             We are surprised to hear that word again;
             You are not suitors!

  _1st S._—                        Yes, your Highness.

  _King._—                                        No!!
             Didn’t you hear our daughter tell you so?
             How can you _suitors_ be when you don’t—

  _Cara._—                                       Hush!
             Oh, father, do not say it—please don’t.

  _King._—                                       Tush!
             It is our duty as a crownèd Prince;
             We can’t descend from speaking plain, to hints.
             You can’t be suitors.

  _Suitors._—                  Tell at any cost!

  _King._—   Because you do not _suit her_!

  (KING _and_ CARA. _burst out into laughter. Suitors get up slowly
  and brush dust off knees._)

  _1st S._—  Of course, if you choose to treat us in this way,
             We obey.

  _2d S._—   I suppose you have the right to be gay
             At our expense—but it won’t pay.

  _3d S._—   You of course can say—anything you choose,
             Certainly you may.

  _4th S._—  But here we shall not stay

  _5th S._—  To hear all the mean things you say,

  _All._—                             Good day.

  _King_ (_turning._).—Hey?
             Ah! they have gone.

  (CARA. _begins to cry._ KING _turns and sees her._)

                                 Hullo! Why how is this?
             What, crying, daughter? Didn’t you dismiss
             These silly men because they didn’t suit?
             I do not understand it—I’m a brute!

  _Cara._—   Oh! dearest father (_aside_, Yes, I’ll tell,) my heart
             Is sad beyond the power of suitor’s art;
             I sigh for other things, and sigh again
             For something else; but always sigh in vain.
             I wait with eager longing for the time
             When I can reach that altitude sublime,
             For which I hope—which in my dreams I see—
             Oh! dearest father, don’t you pity me?

  _King._—   Alas! my daughter, this is hard to hear—
             You’re eating candy far too much, my dear.

  _Cara._—   Oh! no, dear pa.

  _King._—                   Then you in love must be,
             Those symptoms indicate a heart not free.
             You love!!!

  _Cara._—              Ah, yes!

  _King_ (_starting_).—          What!! Do I hear aright?
               You love! (_Aside._) Great guns! my income put to flight.
               When this unfortunate result is told,
               Good-bye to suitors, and to all their gold.
               (_Aloud._) Oh, daughter! daughter! this will never do.
               (_Fiercely._) Who is this _creature_ that’s beloved by you?

  _Cara._—     Ah! yes, I love! but in a different way
               From that expressed by those buffoons to-day.
               My love is sticky.

  _King._—                       _Sticky??_

  _Cara._—                                  Yes, and sweet.
               And _almost_—but not _quite_—too good to eat.

  _King._—     Who is he? Are you raving?

  _Cara._—                               No, dear pa.
               How impolite and curious you are.
               I love!—_oh heavens!_—even in my dreams,
               Molasses candy! gum drops! choc’late creams!
               ’Tis that I love—’tis _candy_ I adore.

  |         Ah!
  |         Beautiful, tender caramel,
  |         Soothing to taste, and pleasant to smell;
  |         Vanilla, lemon, chocolate, move

  |         My sensitive heart far more than suitor’s love.
  |         Tender and fragrant is the smell,
  |         And soothing is the caramel;
  |         Lemon, vanilla, and chocolate, move
  |         My heart far more than suitor’s love.
  |         Lemon, chocolate, sweeter than suitor’s love,

             Can you and Caramella put away.

  _Sassy._—  Excuse me—“Put away.”

             In pounds?

  _Sassy._—            Why, that’s not much.

  _King._—                         You mean to say
             That she eats three-and-twenty pounds a day?
             Ah!—that’s the reason why she fails to see
             The sweetness in her lovers—twenty-three.
  (_Aside._) Good gracious!—twenty-three!!—and _I_ to pay;
             I’ll marry her this very blessed day,
             I will!—What, twenty-three—as I’m a king—

                The table on this side—crammed with all sorts
                Of bottles, boxes, glasses, and retorts;
                Mysterious music here—in sharps and flats,
                And just in front we’ll put that bag of cats,—
                That bag of cats, now, was a fine idea.
  _Stage_ R.    Low music, cats, and thunder over here.
                That side is weird enough—now on the right
  _Stage_ L.    A horrid darkness, now and then a light.
                Which, when it flashes, shows a heap of bones,

                Yes! agonizing moans, and bones, and groans,
                By rattling that big box of paving stones.
                ’Tis fine—the cats on this side—lightning here,
                The lover standing upright in the rear;
                King Nougat there—the Princess standing by,

                _I_—who command, at will, the universe,
                Command by word, where others use the purse;
                Change universal laws the way I please—
                Yea, keep this basket upside down, with ease.
                Ha! ha! _with ease_.

  (_Turns basket of tin pans all over him—quickly picks them up and looks
  around—then speaks low._)

                I mean, _without these_.
                               But now it’s time to mix
                The lover’s vital senses—there are six:
                The sense of locomotion, touch, and sight,
                That’s three—his hearing, voice, and heart—all right.
                I’ll take them all in order, one by one,
                Then Caramella’s lover will be done.

                My dearest, may I speak?

  _Eben._—                              Oh! go ahead.

  _Cara._—      You are to love me dearly, and to wed
                Whenever I am ready. And—what’s more—
                I’m—ready now.

  _Eben._—                     You said all that before.

  _Cara._—      Am I not pretty?

                 Is not so very hard.

  _Eben._—                          I’d rather not.

_Prof._—I see the force of your argument, and also observe the satanic
depression of the eye-brows you refer to; but, for the life of me, I
can’t think of anything but Johnny.

_King._— Well, call him Johnny—quick!

_Prof._ (_turning to Eben_).—Ahem! your name is—

_Cara._ (_suddenly coming front_).—Oh! I have it! It is a name I always
wanted my lover to have. How lucky it was that I remembered it. Oh! it’s
perfectly lovely!

  |             No earthly radiance can compare,
  |             In beauty, with this name so fair.

  | _All._—     No earthly radiance can compare.
  |
  | _Cara._—    This name for which I long have sought,

  |             Most beautiful and charming name—
  |             Most exquisite and lovely name.

                Such horrid sounds—such vile, unearthly yells
                Have echoed hence, as ’twere from deepest hells;

  (_Enter_ PROFESSOR, _slowly, carpet-bag, large comb and brush under his

  _Prof._ (_solil._)—Yes!—here it is—the very point I sought,
                All night I’ve read, and wrestled with great thought,
                And now I have it—Princess, where’s your pa.

  _Cara._—      My father, sir, has gone—

  _Prof._—                              What!

  _Cara._—                                     Gone to war
                ’Gainst Mr. Riley—and I think he means
                To split and smash him into smithereens.

  _Prof._—      To smithereens—to smithereens—Lost!! Lost!!
                To think of all the time and thought he’s cost;
                I’d just discovered—_here_—a recipe,
                By which to change him good as he should be—
                It’s just my luck.

  _Cara._—                        What have you found?

  _Prof._—                                             Observe—
                Guy Fawkes’s hair was parted in a curve,
                Dick Turpin’s parting, in a cue was hid,
                But probably, ’twas just like Captain Kidd,
                Whose hair was parted in a side-long course,
                Also the men who kidnapped Charlie Ross;
                Jeff Davis, Cettawayo, Robespierre,—
                All wicked men, thus parted wore their hair;
                You see the point—these wicked men defied
                Kind nature’s laws by parting on the side;
                George Washington’s was parted, so I’ve read,
                Exactly in the middle of the head;
                Ben Franklin, Martin Luther, Newton, too,
                Mark Twain and Kit Columbus, Richelieu;
                Diogenes, Ben Butler, Cicero,
                Moody and Sankey, and others you well know.
                All these good men, without the barber’s art,
                Had hair which curled out from a centre part.
                Now, Riley’s hair is frizzled in a bang,
                Which places him among the wicked gang.
                I found this point within that ancient tome,
                And could have cured him with this brush and comb.

  _Cara._—      Oh! try it, sir.

  _Prof._—                       They’ve gone!

  _Cara._—                                     It’s not too late!
                Oh! find my pa!

  _Prof._—      I will, as sure as fate!

  (_Exit_ PROF., _running, large gate_ R.)

  _Cara._—      Yes, he is right. (_Looking around audience._)
  (_Solil._)                      I see it everywhere!
                This side and middle parting of the hair.
                I see—(_looking about audience_)—
                That underneath each centre part
                There is a softness both of head and heart;
                And if a parting on the side there be,
                The head and heart is hard.

                  (_Looking about the audience._)

                                            Yes, so I see.

                I wonder why my Eben. rages so,
                That he to our caress returns a blow.
                That mixture was the cause of all this pain,

  (_Looking at_ SASSY., _who cries._)

                And trouble—why, you’re crying once again!

  _Sassy._—     Oh, Princess! I have suffered for a week,
                And cannot stand it longer. I _must_ speak!
                I did it!

  _Cara._—      Sassyfrass!

  _Sassy._—                 Oh, Princess dear!
                I must confess—my crime you now shall hear.

  | _Sassy._—    When Ebenezer’s vital senses
  |              Were lying ’round in little boxes,
  |              A-brooding over his offences,
  |              We entered the Professor’s den,
  |              For vengeance in our hearts was raging.
  |              With wicked zeal we wished to spoil
  |              The beauteous work that he was making—
  |              The grand result of years of toil.

  |              For making of the heart a fixture
  |              Secure in Ebenezer’s frame.
  |              We poured the mixture in a mortar.
  |              And then with vile and wicked art
  |              We did a thing we hadn’t oughter,
  |              We pounded in that Cinnamon Heart.

                There! are you angry? Nay—you smile at this.
                You seem to like it. Is it wrong to kiss?
                But though ’gainst worldly fashion or its law,
                I’ll brave the consequence, and kiss once more.
                But where?—your lips? Your cheek is softer far.
                Your hair?—Your eyes are softer than your hair.
                What shall I kiss? You like it?—then command.

  _Cara._ (_looking at audience_).—They’re looking at us.

  _Eben._—                                        Then I’ll kiss your hand.

                And this is Caramella; is she changed,
                Or have I been demented, mad, deranged?
                I didn’t like her manner; it appeared
                As if she thought I ought to be endeared
                Immediately to her; which, of course,
                I didn’t do.

  _Cara._—                  Why not?

  _Eben._—                           Oh! I felt cross.
                I don’t like to be ordered here and there;
                I have too many troubles now to bear.

  _Cara._—      And have you troubles? Share them, dear, with me.

  _Eben._—      I’ve troubles, yes—particularly three;
                I’d like to find out by what moral right
                A lot of city swells come out to fight
                And chase me ’round the country—that’s the first.
                And then I have a most _infernal_ thirst,
                As if I’d eaten pepper, salt, or cinnamon,—

  _Cara._—      Ah! Cinnamon!!!

  _Eben._—      Yes, and when it’s once begun,
                The pain is terrible—so sharp and tart,
                With such a bad effect upon the heart—
                A burning feeling—like a fiery flame.
                But worst of all _my_ troubles is my name.

  _Cara._—     Oh, I will share _that_!

  _Eben._ (_aside_).—                  Now—what can she mean,
                How can she share that trouble—am I green?
  (_Aloud._)    No!—I suppose I’ll always be stared at
                As “Ebenezer Riley”—think of that!
                It pains me—but the name is for a man.
                _You_ couldn’t share a _man’s_ name.

  _Cara._—                                          Yes, I can!
                _Dear_ Ebenezer! (_Sweetly._)

  _Eben._ (_starting_).—        Ah!—say that again;
                _That_ sounds delightful!—_that_ don’t give me pain;
                That’s _quite_ a pretty name!—Oh say it more,
                It never sounded beautiful before.

  _Cara._—      Oh!—Ebenezer. (_Sweetly._)

  _Eben._—                    Lovely!!—why, it’s fine,
                I wouldn’t _know_ the name—it _can’t_ be mine,

                I’m very glad that you have understood;
                I was afraid you wouldn’t—now let’s talk
                Of our plans—and take a little walk;

  (_Pointing_ L.)

                It’s my especial property and care,
                And as we walk—we will beguile the way
                By saying pretty things—

  _Eben._—                             Yes!—so I say;
                I’ll whisper, first, those pretty things to thee,
                Then you must answer pretty things to me.

  _Cara._—                      Oh what a silly man,
                Now do be good and pleasant, if you can.
                I dream of you as charming—Ah! those dreams!

  (EBEN. _smiles sweetly._)

                That’s right—that’s how you look.

  (KING _looks out of window._)

  _King_ (_aside_).—                              How sweet he seems.

  (EBEN. _and_ CARA. _turn and see_ KING.)

  _Cara._—      Oh!—there’s Papa! (_Joyfully._)

  _Eben._ (_satirically_).—       Yes!—there’s Papa!

  _Cara._—                                            Oh—come!
                Come down and see us—we are waiting.

  _King_ (_doubtingly_).—                            Hum!!
  (_Aside to_ CARA.) He’s safe?

  _Cara._—                     I’ve made of him a perfect cure.

  _Eben._ (_through teeth._)                             Oh yes!—I’m cured!
                      (_Aside._) I have him this time, sure!!

  (EBEN. _picks up gun, and begins to turn back cuffs_—KING_ leaves
  window._)

  _Cara._—      Oh!—isn’t this delightful—here we are,
                All three united—you and I, and Pa.

  _Eben._ (_satirically_).—Oh yes!—it’s very pleasant.

  (_Enter_ KING C. _door—comes forward very blusteringly._)

  _King._—                                              Ah!—how do!
                How are you Riley—glad to welcome you.
                I didn’t know that you were here—before;
                Come, shake hands and be friends again!

  _Eben._ (_yelling_).—                                Hoo—raw!!

  (_Turns and jumps at_ KING _with gun._)

                I have you this time—lone and overpowered,
                And now I’ll give you fits—you bloody coward.

  (_Chasing and hitting_ King.)

  _Cara._—      Oh!—Ebenezer!!

  _King_ (_running_).—         Murder!!—help!!

  _Eben._ (_chasing and striking_ KING).—        Hoo—raw!!

  (KING _falls_—EBENEZER _strikes as he speaks._)

                Take that!—and that!—and that!—and more!
                Take that!—and that!—and that!—(_etc. ad lib. until_

  (SUITORS _rush in—capture_ EBEN.—SUITORS _sit on him._)

  (KING _rises slowly and rubs himself._)

  _King._—      Good gracious!—Oh!—my back.

  _Capt._—                                    We have him tight!

  _Cara._—      Don’t hurt him!

  _Eben._—                      Let me go and I will fight
                The whole ungainly pack of you—let go
                Unhand me!!

  (_Struggles to get free—rises but is held by_ SUITORS.)

  _King._—                  Silence!!

  _Cara._—                            Give him freedom.

  _King._—                                               No!
                Just take him to the dungeon—let me see,
                The darkest and most dirty—forty-three—
                In forty-three secure him to the floor
                With irons—pound and kick him ’till he’s raw;
                Scrape him with files—put him upon the rack—
                Let’s see—what else—Oh—cauterize his back.
                That’s all I think——

  _Cara._—                             Oh Father—Father!

  _King_ (_to Capt._).—                                   Go!!

  (_Exeunt_ CAPT. _and_ SUITORS, _leading_ EBEN.—CARA. _sinks down
  sobbing._)

  _Cara._ (_starting up_).—
                I pray you Father—

  _King_ (_aside_).—                Here it comes—I know.

  _Cara._—      Oh Father—dearest Father—hear me now,
                I charge you, Father—yes—by all your—

  _King_ (_interrupting, and calling loudly_).—         Captain!!

  (_Aside._)    I’m not going to be wheedled over to mercy—if she charges
  me I know I’ll explode.

  (_Enter Capt._)

  (_Loudly._)   Captain, I say—well—what do you
                Stand there looking at——
                Why don’t you bring him out?

  _Capt._—      Who—Riley?

  _King._—      Of course—Riley—who else should
                I mean—why don’t you obey me, sir?
                Bring him out!

  _Capt._—      Yes, sir.

  _King._—      Bring a block!

  _Capt._—      Yes, sir.

  _King._—      Bring the executioner!

  _Capt._—      Yes, sir.

  _King_ (_low_).—And captain, invite all the maids to the execution—25
                cents a ticket—they’ll pay it. (_Loud._) Well—why
                don’t you obey—do you hear me?

  |
  | _King._—    This is a very unpleasant situation,
  |             But we must proceed without further hesitation.
  |             This _is as_ good a way as I knows—

  |             This _is as_ good a way as he knows
  |             To dispose of his foes.

  | (_Interlude._)
  |
  | _Maids._—   Oh! he’s going to have his head cut off—
  |             Oh! how horrid he will look!
  |
  | _All._—     Shish! shish! shish! shish!
  |             Never more—no, never, can he have his
  |             Picture took. Never more—no, never, can he have his

  | (EXECUTIONER _prepares to cut_ EBEN.’S _head off with scissors._)
  |
  | _King._—    Proceed!—why do you hesitate?
  |
  | _Maids._—   Oh! he’s going to begin!
  |             Oh! I wish we had the money back we
  |             Paid for our tickets.
  |
  | _Suitors._— Just look at him—
  |
  | _All._—     He’s going for to cut his head off!
  |             He’s going for to cut his head off!!

No. 10.

  | _Prof._—    Hold!
  |
  | (_Fast._)   Never was a time when so fast I’ve had to travel,
  |             Jumping over ditches and tremendous heaps of gravel,
  |             Back yards, pits, and innumerable brick kilns,
  |             Coal bins, ash heaps, otherwise impregnable;
  |             Mud, dirt, wet and objectionable odors,
  |             Chemically mixed of asafœtida and sodas,
  |             Hedges, holes, apparently impossible,
  |             Striving to stop this horrible slaughter.
  |
  |        (_Opens book—pointing to it significantly._)
  |
  | (_Slowly._) _Omnes boni_—all good men.
  |             _In medio_—in the middle of the head.
  |             _Capitam_—all the hair.
  |             _Dividunt_—they divide.
  |             Part their hair in the middle of the head—so—
  | (_Fast._)   Putting this important observation into practice,
  |             The interesting and absorbing scientific fact is,
  |             If a person is too excitable,
  |             Send for a brush and comb.
  |
  | (_Recit._)  Just observe the demonstration of this point.
  |
  | (_Turns to_ EBEN.—_takes out comb and brush and begins to part his
  | hair in the middle while singing._)
  |
  | _Eben._—    Away—away—away! I tell you stand away!!
  |
  | _Prof._—    Now, Ebenezer, please be still.
  |
  | _All._—     Please be still—please be still.
  |
  | _Prof._—    And with this comb I’ll cure your ill.
  |
  | _All._—     Riley, please be still.
  |
  | _King._—    It’s pleasant, if you knew it.
  |
  | _All._—     Please be still—please be still.
  |
  | _Eben._—    I’d like to see you do it.
  |
  | _All._—     Riley, please be still.

  | _All._—                                         Success!
  |
  | _Prof._—    Oh! I am a great astrologer—
  |
  | _All._—     A regular sockdologer.
  |
  | _Prof._—    A graduated colleger,
  |             My name is Finigin,
  |             I get my knowledge from the stars,
  |             From pickled snakes put up in jars,
  |             From dead men’s wired vertebras,
  |             From skulls of apes and men.

  |             And caused my madness to depart.
